# 🔐 Artisan Bot – Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 18-August-2025

Artisan is a custom Discord bot developed for the Compulsion guild community. This Privacy Policy explains what data Artisan collects, how it’s used, and how we protect it.

---

## 1. 📊 What We Collect

Artisan only collects data necessary to support its features. This may include:

- Discord user IDs (for role assignment and command tracking)
- Profession and recipe data (synced from the in-game addon)
- Guild role mappings and configuration settings
- Command usage logs (for debugging and cooldown enforcement)

We do **not** collect:
- Personal information (e.g. names, emails, passwords)
- Private messages or DMs
- Location data or IP addresses

---

## 2. 🧠 How We Use Your Data

Data collected by Artisan is used solely to:

- Coordinate crafting and profession workflows within the guild
- Assign roles and permissions based on profession status
- Improve bot performance and usability
- Enforce cooldowns and prevent spam

We do not sell, share, or expose your data to third parties.

---

## 3. 🧵 Data Storage & Security

As of initial publishing, Artisan stores data in a file-based database (Sqlite) for ease of portability as this is an open source bot. However, if funding allows, I would be willing to upgrade to a more secure environment (e.g. MongoDB or Azure Cosmos DB) and host the bot globally for anyone else that wants a subscription. Access to the Sqlite database is also currently restricted to authorized maintainers.

We take reasonable steps to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion.

---

## 4. 🧹 Data Retention & Removal

Data is retained only as long as needed to support bot functionality. You may request removal of your data by contacting the bot maintainer.

If you leave the guild or stop using Artisan, your data may be automatically purged after a period of inactivity.

---

## 5. 🧪 Third-Party Services

Artisan may interact with external APIs (e.g. Battle.net) to sync profession data. These services have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

Artisan does not transmit personal data to these services.

---

## 6. 🛡️ Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Request access to the data Artisan stores about you
- Ask for corrections or deletions
- Opt out of certain features (where applicable)

To exercise these rights, contact the bot maintainer via Discord or GitHub.
